 * A directory named after a run rather than after a codebase. Tooling that
 * checks a repo out per run - a no-mistakes gate worktree lives at
 * `<hash>.git/worktrees/<ULID>`, a treehouse worktree at `<slug>-<6hex>`, and
 * CI runners use similar shapes - leaves a working directory whose last
 * segment is an opaque id. A ULID (26 Crockford base32 characters), a UUID, a
 * bare hex hash, or a slug carrying a random hex suffix names no codebase to
 * anyone.
 *
 * The ULID branch is uppercase-only, which the other two are not. Crockford is
 * canonically uppercase and every real gate worktree is
 * (`01M08C82C40W5Y5Q0X3BFGYNFT`), while lowercase 26-character run-together
 * words are ordinary codebase names - `backendservermanagementapp` uses none of
 * Crockford's excluded letters, and a case-insensitive branch swallowed it.
 * The hex branch cannot be uppercase-only: git SHAs are lowercase, so that
 * would silently disable it while looking like a fix. Length does the work
 * there instead - only a full SHA-1 (40) or SHA-256 (64) hex string is
 * refused, so a shorter all-hex codebase name is never swallowed.
 *
 * The suffix branch - `dazzling-lamarr-0aacbd`, `upwork-automation-build-c164f2` -
 * is deliberately the narrowest of the four, because it is the only one whose
 * shape a real codebase could plausibly wear. It requires a non-empty slug, a
 * hyphen, then six or more lowercase hex characters carrying *both* a digit
 * and a letter. Each half of that rule keeps a real repository out of its
 * operator's bucket: without the digit the six-letter words that spell hex -
 * `decade`, `facade`, `beaded` - are swallowed, and without the letter every
 * dated or numbered directory is - `invoices-202601`, `release-20240115`,
 * `sprint-123456`. Roughly one random suffix in 16 is all-letters or
 * all-digits and slips through; that is the accepted ceiling, and it costs
 * nothing, because identity comes from the remote (`identityRepoKey`) and only
 * the label ever consults this. Needing this regex to hold the line means the
 * remote never reached the lane, which is the finding, not the fix.

/**
 * The value an agent identity is keyed on, in preference order.

 *    worktree, in a second checkout of the same repository under another
 *    directory name, and on another machine - which is the whole point. Keying
 *    on the repo root instead is what put five `precisiondocs` rows on one
 *    operator's roster: every treehouse worktree is its own path, so every
 *    worktree minted its own agent, and because the name is composed from the
 *    last segment all five rendered the same string. Keyed by path, displayed
 *    by basename.
 * 2. **The repo root, as `path:<root>`.** A repository with no remote is
 *    legitimate and must not collapse into one bucket with every other
 *    local-only repository, so its own directory identifies it - the best
 *    available answer, and the same answer identity gave before remotes were
 *    read. Its own lane so it can never collide with a remote, and the root is
 *    carried through verbatim: this lane must reproduce exactly the identity
 *    the repo-root key already gave, or `0016_agent_identity_by_remote`'s
 *    backfill would fold two live rows onto one key and abort on the unique
 *    index it then builds. Git emits one spelling of a root, so there is
 *    nothing to normalize away, and since the desktop resolves the main
 *    repository root rather than the worktree toplevel it once sent,
 *    worktrees of one repository share that root too.
 * 3. **Nothing.** Work that happened outside any repository at all, which is
 *    the honest unassigned case: the operator's bucket, shared by every such
 *    shift rather than minting a row each.
 *
 * A working directory that names only a run reaches lane 2 as no name at all,
 * so it falls to lane 3 - but only when the remote is missing too. A gate
 * worktree of a real repository has a remote, and that remote is what it is.
