            records them. <InstallerLink />

          <li>
            <strong>Hours are filed under a project.</strong> If an AI coding tool is working in a
            folder matched to a project, they go there; if someone picks a project, they go there.
            Anything else lands in that person's default project, and shows up here as
            unattributed.

        <ul className="record-list">
          <li>Recorded is the whole of your sessions, quiet inside them included - a break too short to end one, or an agent left running while you were away. It is always at least your hours, and the difference is time away from the keyboard, not agent time.</li>
          <li>Your hours are wall-clock time you were actually at the machine. They can never exceed real elapsed time.</li>
          <li>Human work is the time you worked with no agent running - the share you verified yourself.</li>
          <li>The 1, 2, and 3+ agent splits are your agent-assisted share - still your hours, split by how many agents ran beside you at once.</li>
          <li>Agent time is the summed runtime of every AI tool working for you. Three agents in parallel for an hour is 3h of agent time inside 1h of yours - that ratio is your leverage, never extra hours.</li>
          <li>An agent still working while you step away keeps counting as agent time, but never as your hours.</li>
          <li>The leaderboard ranks by your hours. Agent time and leverage sit beside them, answering a different question: how much work you got out of the tools.</li>

          Everyone sees the same numbers. The app shows each person their own hours, added up
          exactly the way this dashboard adds up the team's, with the same split between hours filed
          under a project on purpose and hours that fell to the default. Open
          {" "}<strong>What's recorded</strong> in the app to see what it is keeping on your computer
          right now, and to switch all of it off.
