          <li>Your hours are wall-clock time you were actually at the machine. They can never exceed real elapsed time.</li>
          <li>Human work is the time you worked with no agent running - the share you verified yourself.</li>

          <li>
            <strong>You do nothing.</strong> While this app is open and recording is on, SIQshift writes down the
            hours you spend at this computer. There is no button to press and no timer to forget.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A stretch of work ends when you stop.</strong> Go quiet for a while, lock the screen, or shut
            the computer down, and that stretch is closed at the moment you stopped. Quiet time is never counted -
            but hands-off work is: a video playing, a call, or a presentation keeps the stretch open.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Your hours are filed under a project.</strong> If an AI tool is working in a folder you have
            matched to a project, they go there. Otherwise they go to
            {" "}<strong>{defaultProjectName ?? "your default project"}</strong>, and you can pick a different one
            whenever you like.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You see what your team sees.</strong> The same hours, added up the same way, on the SIQshift
            website. Hours filed under a project on purpose are counted separately from hours that just fell to the
            default, so nobody has to guess.
