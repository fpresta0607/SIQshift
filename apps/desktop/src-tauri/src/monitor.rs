//! The OS activity monitor: signals in, coarse segments out, and the pure
//! away/auto-stop policy the stop flow and the UI both consume.
//!
//! Lightweight by construction: one Tokio task wakes every 30 seconds and asks
//! the OS read-only questions (`GetLastInputInfo`, the foreground process
//! name - the name only, never a window title). When the input answer says
//! idle, three more read-only checks can still rescue the tick as hands-off
//! work (media playing, presentation or busy state, microphone in use), each
//! fail-closed: a check that cannot answer never rescues. Lock and suspend
//! arrive as broadcasts on a hidden window owned by a dedicated thread, so
//! between events the monitor costs nothing. There are no hooks, no injection,
//! and no per-keystroke cost.
//!
//! The signal stream folds into transition-based segments (`active`, `idle`,
//! `locked`, `suspended`), so a workday produces dozens of rows, not ticks.
//! Closed segments are appended to a local spool immediately (same durability
//! discipline as the agent spool) and the uploader in `uploader.rs` batches
//! them to the API. Everything above the `platform` module is pure logic with
//! an injected clock; the Win32 calls never run in tests.
//!
//! Monitoring is gated behind `MonitorSettings.enabled` (on by default for
//! new installs); disabling it aborts both tasks, so a paused monitor records
//! nothing.
//!
//! Tradeoff, documented: the event thread uses a real hidden top-level window
//! rather than a message-only one because Windows does not broadcast
//! `WM_POWERBROADCAST` to message-only windows. Session unlock and
//! resume-from-suspend deliberately raise no event — the next poll's
//! Active/Idle signal closes the span, which is the same code path a
//! transition would take.
