/**
 * Runtime marks for the "what's switched on" list and the live session stats.
 *
 * Two kinds of mark ship here, and the difference matters legally.
 *
 * An **official asset** ships only when the project publishes one under a
 * licence that lets SIQshift redistribute it. Today that is opencode alone: its
 * mark ships in `sst/opencode` under the MIT licence the rest of that
 * repository carries.
 *
 * Every other runtime gets a **SIQshift mark**: an original monochrome glyph
 * drawn for this app, from one coherent set, in `currentColor` on a 24×24 grid.
 * These are deliberately *not* imitations of anybody's logo. Anthropic, OpenAI,
 * Cursor, Moonshot, xAI, and GitHub all publish brand assets under terms that
 * do not permit redistribution in a third-party app, and drawing a lookalike
 * from memory would misrepresent somebody else's product while infringing the
 * same trademark. An original glyph naming a runtime inside SIQshift's own UI
 * is honest about whose drawing it is and needs no licence from anyone.
 *
 * The roster's `icon` field selects the mark, so a runtime gains one by naming
 * it there and adding it below.
