/**
 * The agent-runtime roster, loaded from `agent-runtimes.json`.
 *
 * That file is the *only* place a runtime is declared. The API's ingest path,
 * the desktop's labels and process folding, the capture probes and connection
 * instructions, and the quota dials all read it, so adding a runtime is a
 * configuration change rather than a code change. The Rust host reads the same
 * JSON (`agent_runtimes.rs` embeds it), so the two languages cannot drift.
 *
 * The roster is *not* an allowlist. `agentSourceSchema` accepts any id of the
 * canonical shape, so a runtime nobody has declared yet is still recorded under
 * its own name rather than collapsed into `other` or dropped. The roster only
 * decides what SIQshift can say *about* a runtime: its display name, its
 * executables, where its capture config lives, and which quota dial it backs.
