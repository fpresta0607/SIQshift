/**
 * Folds an operator's duplicate agents - one per worktree, one per checkout -
 * onto the single identity their git remote names, and re-keys the survivor on
 * that remote. Dry run by default: prints exactly what it would merge into
 * what, and exits. Pass --confirm to perform it.
 *
 *   DATABASE_URL=postgres://... node scripts/repair-agent-identity-by-remote.mjs
 *   DATABASE_URL=postgres://... node scripts/repair-agent-identity-by-remote.mjs --owner you@example.com --confirm
 *
 * Identity used to be (organization, owner, source, repo_root), and a repo
 * root is a *path*. Every treehouse worktree is its own path, so every worktree
 * minted its own agent; because the display name is composed from the last
 * segment, five different identities all rendered "Claude Code @ novawebsite".
 * Keyed by path, displayed by basename. Two checkouts of one GitHub repository
 * under different directory names - `C:\dev\NovaWebsite-AI` and
 * `C:\dev\relay-app\projects\novawebsite` - are the same defect with no
 * basename to compare at all.
 *
 * `0016_agent_identity_by_remote` moved the key onto `agents.repo_key` and
 * carried every existing row across as `path:<root>`, which preserves exactly
 * the identity it already had. This upgrades those keys to remotes and merges
 * whatever collapses together.
 *
 * **The remote is not in the database.** Nothing has ever uploaded it, so it
 * can only be read from a machine that holds the checkouts - which is why this
 * runs locally against the shared database rather than as a migration. A row
 * whose `repo_root` is not a directory on this machine is left exactly as it
 * is and reported: we cannot read what it points at, so we cannot say what its
 * key should be.
 *
 * Two different questions, so two guards. Presence on disk answers "can I read
 * what this row points at". It does not answer "are these rows mine to touch",
 * because the same absolute path on two machines is two different
 * repositories: `C:/dev/api` is somebody's checkout on every one of them. So
 * `--owner <email or user id>` names the one operator whose rows a run may
 * write, and `--confirm` refuses without it. The dry run may be taken without
 * `--owner`, because the whole roster is what makes it worth reading; it
 * labels every line with whose row it is and closes by naming the `--owner`
 * value each plan needs. With `--owner`, both passes consider only that
 * operator's rows, so the plan printed is the plan performed.
 *
 * Rules, none of them negotiable:
 *
 * - **Merge, never delete.** Shifts, `shift_commits` and `agent_usage` all
 *   follow their agent onto the survivor, and the emptied row is retired, not
 *   removed. A repair that loses a shift is worse than the duplicates.
 * - **Idempotent.** A second run finds every group already collapsed and every
 *   key already correct, and does nothing.
 * - **A name a member chose is not ours to revisit.** A `registered` row wins
 *   its group; a group holding two of them is refused whole rather than
 *   picking one.
 * - **Everything is decided before anything is written.** `planRepair` settles
 *   every group, every winner and every target key against the rows as they
 *   are now, and validates each target against the live rows that hold keys;
 *   the writer only executes what the dry run printed. A group whose key is
 *   held by a row outside it is refused there, not discovered by a unique
 *   violation two transactions into the run.
 *
 * It also reports the unassigned bucket without touching it: how much of that
 * time was genuinely unattributable and how much is a resolution failure.
 * Re-homing those shifts is `repair-run-named-agents.mjs`'s job. The two
 * repairs are independent, and this one is the better first move: it reads
 * `remote.origin.url` out of the directory `repo_root` names, while the fold
 * moves a row to the bucket and discards that root.

 * behind would report as a healthy repository with no remote. `--local` reads

/**
 * What this run would do, decided before anything is printed or written.
 *

 * A row whose `repo_root` is not a directory on this machine is inert - never
 * a group member, never a merge winner or loser, never re-keyed - because the
 * only key we could compose for it is `path:<root>`, and writing that over a
 * remote key would split that repository back across its worktrees, which is
 * the defect this script exists to undo. It is also what keeps a second run
 * idempotent once a worktree has been deleted. It says nothing about who owns
 * a row - a write pass only ever sees the rows `--owner` selected, so the rows
 * this reasons over are already one operator's.
 *
 * A `local-only` row does take part: its own directory is the right identity
 * for a repository with no remote, and it is the key that row already carries,
 * so it settles without a write. The one exception is a row whose origin was
 * removed after it had been keyed on that remote - demoting it would be the
 * same split by another route, so it is refused too.
 *
 * Inert cuts both ways, which is what `contended` is for. A row this run
 * cannot read still holds its key, and the unique index covers exactly the
 * live rows, so a group resolving to a key such a row holds is refused whole
 * rather than merged into it or re-keyed past it. A later run from the machine
 * that holds that checkout resolves the pair properly.
 *
 * `resolve` is injected so this can be exercised without checkouts on disk.

/**
 * The unassigned bucket, read and never written. The roster shows one row
 * holding far more time than any codebase's, which says the resolution was
 * failing rather than that the work was really unattributable - so the
 * question "how much of each?" deserves a number rather than a shrug.
 *
 * Four answers, in order of how much they let us say:
 *
 * - a shift whose own commit names a codebase is a resolution failure with
 *   proof, and `repair-run-named-agents.mjs` re-homes exactly these;
 * - a shift whose working directory names a codebase probably is one too - a
 *   hook older than the repo probe reported no root at all - but a directory
 *   is not proof that it was a repository;
 * - a shift whose directory names only a run belongs in the bucket;
 * - a shift with no directory at all is genuinely unattributable.
