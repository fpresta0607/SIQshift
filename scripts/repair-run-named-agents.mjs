/**
 * Folds agents named after a run back into their operator's unassigned bucket,
 * and clears the placeholder models stored beside them. Dry run by default:
 * prints exactly what would move and exits. Pass --confirm to perform it.
 *
 *   DATABASE_URL=postgres://... node scripts/repair-run-named-agents.mjs [--confirm]
 *
 * Tooling that checks a repo out per run leaves a working directory named after
 * the run rather than the codebase - a no-mistakes gate worktree lives at
 * `<hash>.git/worktrees/<ULID>`. Because identity keys on the repo root, every
 * such run minted its own agent, and because the default name is composed from
 * the root's last segment, each read
 * "Claude Code @ 01M06FSGP392MH6VJNRX8T364A". The identity-v2 backfill did not
 * create these; it re-attributed shifts onto the roots the commits named, which
 * is what surfaced them at scale.
 *
 * The API now refuses an opaque segment as a codebase name (`repoLabel`) and as
 * an identity key (`identityRepoRoot`), so no new row can be minted this way.
 * This repairs the rows already stored.
 *
 * Since `0016_agent_identity_by_remote` a row is keyed on `agents.repo_key`
 * and its `repo_root` is only evidence of where the work happened, so a row
 * whose key names a repository is never folded however its directory reads: a
 * gate worktree of a real repository is correctly identified, not run-named.
 *
 * Each run-named agent merges into the one unassigned agent for its
 * (organization, owner, source): shifts, `shift_commits` and `agent_usage`
 * follow, then the emptied row is retired. Nothing is deleted, and an agent a
 * member has renamed is left alone - a name someone chose is not ours to
 * revisit, even on a row keyed this way.
 *
 * It also re-homes bucket shifts that carry their own commit evidence. A hook
 * older than the repo probe reported no repo root at all, so every shift
 * minted into its operator's unassigned bucket even when it ran in a real
 * checkout. A commit's repo root is proof the directory really was a
 * repository; a recorded cwd alone is not - a shift launched in any real
 * non-repo directory is bucketed by design with that cwd stored. Each shift
 * with a commit moves onto the codebase its first commit names (first by
 * authored_at then id, the rule the paystub and graduation already follow):
 * an existing agent of the same (organization, owner, source) rendering the
 * same codebase label when there is one, else a fresh identity keyed on
 * `path:<that commit's repo root>`, which is what `identityRepoKey` composes
 * when no remote is known. A root whose last segment is opaque stays put - a
 * gate worktree's commit reports the worktree path, which names only a run.
 * A shift with no commit stays in the bucket, which is self-limiting: no date
 * cutoff is needed, and a re-run stays safe forever.
 *
 * It also clears the model a runtime never attested. A CLI marks the entries
 * it writes about itself - Claude Code stamps them `<synthetic>` - and a
 * desktop old enough to read one out of a transcript stored it as the shift's
 * model, which is why the roster read "Claude Code · <synthetic>". Both the
 * reader and the API refuse it now, but the rows already stored keep rendering
 * it until they are nulled. `agent_usage.model` is deliberately left alone:
 * its bucket unique is nullsNotDistinct and the upsert folds with GREATEST, so
 * collapsing two distinct buckets onto null would undercount the tokens.
